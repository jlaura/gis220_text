# Overview
This week concludes both the network analysis sections and this course. Congratulations on having done a wonderful job!  This week is designed to bring together the graph/network chapter from last week and a number of the mathematical techniques that we learned through the semester.  We focus on spatial interaction models, network constrained point processess, and an explorations of Snow's classic Cholera study.

## Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter and the associated assignment, you will be able to:

* define, formulate, and compute a spatial interaction model;
* leverage computational geometry methods to snap a point pattern to a network;
* compute a network constrained Moran's I statistic;
* formulate the Huff Gravity model and describe multiple distance decay functions.
