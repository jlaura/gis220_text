# Summary
This week we concluded our focus on matrices and systems of linear equations by solving two different types of optimization problems.  We solved a general case optimization problem using the simplex method. Next we solved an integer programming problem by solving many simplex problems in the branch and bound algorithm.  The brevity of the descriptions belies the complexity of both of these methods.
