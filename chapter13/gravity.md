# Spatial Interaction

Spatial interaction models seek to represent the flow between locations.  This could be the flow of people from suburban residences to urban employment centers, or the bi-directional flow of goods and services between nations (international trade).  As geographers, we are intimately aware of the strong influence the spatial component of a problem has and spatial interaction models seek to leverage this.


We will continue to use the text from Dr. Jean-Paul Rodrigue (linked below) for this course material.

  * In section 3, please follow the link to explore [three basic types of interaction models](https://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/methods/threebasicmodels.html).  This pagewill formulate 3 models that we will utilize.
