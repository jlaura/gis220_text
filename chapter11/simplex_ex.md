# Simplex Example

In this section, we will solve the previous optimization problem using the simplex method.

Here is the previous optimization problem in matrix form:

Remember, all initial **BV**s should be eliminated from Row 0, by having 0 coefficient.

Then initialize tableau form. Coefficient of entering variable wears a hat. As coefficient of BV is always 1, you can easily recognize which variable is BV. A pivot element for each iteration written in blue with shade.

At the initial iteration, as coefficients of both decision variables are identical, pick any one of them. Here we select ùë•1 as the entering variable. Then we need to determine the pivot element. Calculate ratio of
each element in work column, except the element in Row 0. 42 = 2 and 31 = 3. We should choose lesser one, so 2 (Row 1) is pivot element, and Row 1 is pivot row.

Next step is making coefficient of the pivot element to 1. Then we make other elements in work column to 0 by elementary row operation, to make ùë•1 to the basic variable. We will not visit every step of elementary row operation here. But I recommend solve this problem by yourself. Result is like below.

Basic solution of 1st iteration is:

<center>$$x_{1} = 2, x_{4} = 1, x_{2} = x_{3} = 0, z = 2$$</center>

Is this solution optimal? Not yet, as we still have the negative coefficient in Row 0. Naturally, ùë•2
becomes the new entering variable. To select the pivot, calculate the ratio $$\dfrac{2}{1/2} = 4$$, $$\dfrac{1}{3/2} = \dfrac{2}{3}$$, so $$\dfrac{3}{2}$$ is the pivot element.  The result is:

Now we have no negative coefficient in Row 0. So the simplex algorithm terminates here. Optimized solution & objective value:

<center>$$x_{1} = \dfrac{5}{3}$$, $$x_{2} = \dfrac{2}{3}$$, $$z = \dfrac{7}{3}$$</center>

We don‚Äôt need to worry about slack variables, as they are NBV, so value is equal to 0.
