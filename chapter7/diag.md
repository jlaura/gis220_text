# Diagonal and Identity Matrices

A diagonal matrix is a square matrix that is filled with zeros except on the main diagonal (upper left to lower right).  For example:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 4
\end{bmatrix}$$

and 

$$\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -6 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 10 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

An identity matrix is a diagonal matrix that has ones on the main diagonal.  An identity matrix is notated as $$I$$  For example:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$$

and 

$$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$$

An important property of the identity matrix is that it is like the number one:

**AI** = **A** and **IA** = **A**
