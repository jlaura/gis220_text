# Overview
This is week one (of three) where we introduce (or review) linear algebra.  We will be focusing on working with matrices and solving problems ammenable to a regular, matrix representation.

## Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter and the assocaiated assignment, you will be able to:

* identify the order of a matrix and describe methods to notate element position in a matrix;
* add, subtract, and multiple a matric by a scalar;
* multiple two matrices and identify those instances where multiplication is not possible due to the matrix order;
* transpose a matrix;
* illustrate, graphically individual vectors and the addition/subtraction of vectors.
