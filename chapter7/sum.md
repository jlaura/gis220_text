# Summary
In this chapter we introduced matrices and matrix notation.  First, matrix addition,  subtraction, and scalar multiplication - element-wise operations - were introduced.  Next, the mechanics of matrix multiplication were described.  Matrix transposition, diagonal matrices, and identity matrices were introduced next.  We concluded with a demonstration of graphical vector representation.
