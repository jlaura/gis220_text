# Summary

This preliminary chapter is meant to prepare students for success in *Mathematical Principals of GIS*. 

In this chapter we have described this course text, and the online and offline methods this for access (including the ability to print the text or download it to an eReader).  The Roles and Responsibilties section describes what expectations the students and instructor can anticipate.  The graded components of this course is described in the Assignments section and students can anticipate completing thirteen week assignments and two exams via the BlackBoard course management system.  In the Communication section we describe the two primary means for communication - the course discussion forums and email.  The former is ideal all but private communications and should be the first place you consider posting a question about the course, text, assignments, or exams.

In my opinion, the section entitled Three Habits of a Successful learner is most important as it provides three essential tenants for success in any online course: (1) devote sufficient time and effort, (2) communicate effectively, and (3) approach learning reflectively.
