# Introduction

Dr. Jean-Paul Rodrigue and Dr. Cesar Ducruet of Hofstra University teach a course on transportation analysis and a key component of that course is network (or graph) based analysis.  The mathematical introduction that they provide is wonderful.  Therefore, please read [Graph Theory: Definitions and Principals](https://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/methods/ch1m2en.html).  The reading is relatively short, and I would suggest following the links that throughout the document to provide additional information.  For example, the text describes the difference between a planar and non-planar graph, but the linked supplemental page includes an image that, in my opinion, makes the distinction even clearer.

Next, please see the first section of [Network Data Models](https://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/methods/ch2m3en.html).  Sections 2 - 4 are not required readings.
