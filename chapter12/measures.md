# Graph Descriptive Statistics (Measures)

As with the previous section, we will continue to look at the Hofstra graph theory pages.  Please see the following:

On [Graph Theory: Measures and Indices](https://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/methods/ch1m3en.html), please check out the following in order:

* Section 1 - Measures at the Network Level
  * Please read the entire section (quite short)
* Section 2 - Indices at the Network level
  * Cost
  * Alpha Index
  * Average Shortest Path
* Section 3 - Measures and Indices at the Node level
  * Order of a Node
  * Shimbel Index (think about how this metric can help compute Diameter)
  * Betweenness Centrality
  * Average Nearest Neighbor Distance
