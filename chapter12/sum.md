# Summary
This week we introduced graphs and their use to represent topological networks.  After identifying multiple types of graphs, we explored metrics that can be use to summarize different characteristics of graphs, nodes, and edges.  Next we reviewed network distance computation and offered a small example of the error that can be introduced by ignoring the network constraint on distance problems.  Finally, we identified a few canonical problems in network analysis including the classic traveling salesperson problem (a favorite of computer scientists and operations research practitioners.)
