# Overview
The next two chapters deal with probability, distributions, and sampling.  GISystems provide a wealth of spatially aware statistical analysis methods.  Many of these are dependent upon computing probabilities of some process(es) occuring or some phenominom being observable.  This chapter focuses specifically on probability.

## Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter and the assocaiated assignment, you will be able to:

* identify the statistics notation used for probability; 
* define permutation and combination;
* compute independent and conditional probabilities;
* identify uses of probability within the spatial analysis and spatial statistics domains.
