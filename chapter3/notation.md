# Notation

The notation of probability within statistics draws heavily from set notation in general mathematics.  The notation is also similar to function notation.

* P(A) - the probability (P) that event A will occur
* P(A|B) - the **conditional probability** that event A will occur if event B has occurred.  You may also see conditional probability notated as P(A:B).
* P(A$$'$$) - the probability of the **complement** of event A.  This is the probability that event A does not occur.
* P(A $$\cap$$ B) - the probability of the **intersection** of events A and B.  This is the probability that two independent events occur.  The intersection is an **AND** relationship.  You may also see joint probability (intersection) written as P(A & B). (I prefer this former notation).
* P(A $$\cup$$ B) - the probability of the **union** of events A and B.  This is the probability that either A or B will occur.  The union is an **or** relationship.
* E(X) is the **expected** value of a random variable X.
* $$_{n}P_{r}$$ - refers to the number of **permutations** of $$n$$ things taken $$r$$ at a time. (Described fully in the permutation module.)
* $$_{n}P_{r}$$ - refers to the number of **combinations** of $$n$$ things taken $$r$$ at a time. (Described fully in the combinations module.)
