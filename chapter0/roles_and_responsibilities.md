# Roles and Responsibilities

## Registered Students
As a registered student, your role is to read chapters, complete sample problem sets and assignments, and complete both exams on schedule.  The schedule of assignments is available via BlackBoard and is included in the course syllabus.  The amount of time you invest in this course will vary depending on your familiarity with the mathematical principals and comfort completing problem sets.  In general, you can anticipate spending approximately 3 hours per credit per week on the course content (~9 hours per week).  Although there are weekly assignment deadlines, you are absolutely free to study at places and times that are most convenient to you.

## Instructors
The instructor will present the course text and materials and follow all course communications, including email and BlackBoard discussion forums.  The instructor will generally reply to most communications within 24 hours.  Some forum posts may be intentionally left longer for responses from fellow students).  The instructor also updates and revise the course text as necessary.  They assess student progress and keep grading software up to date.
