# Assignments

The course consists of thirteen assignments and two exams.

#### Thirteen Assignments, accounting for 60% of your grade
In conjunction with weekly readings, students are assigned an assignment worth 50 points.  The assignments link directly to the course readings and are designed to practice and master the concepts introduced or reviewed in the course text.  Assignments will be made available the Thursday before the course week officially begins and are the due twelve days later.  For example, this course begins Thursday, August 18th.  The first assignment (E1) will be available on the 18th, officially assigned on Tuesday the 23rd and due on Tuesday the 30th at midnight (Tempe).

Assignments will have an unlimited number of submissions via Blackboard and the highest point score will be the recorded grade.  Of the thirteen assignments, only the top 12 will be used to compute your final grade.

#### Two Exams, accounting for 40% of your grade
Two open book, online exams will appear via Blackboard.  The exam is identical to the assignments in format and style.  Most students will find the exams to be fairly challenging and successful completion of the exams will have demonstrated that you have sufficiently mastered the presented mathematical foundations.
