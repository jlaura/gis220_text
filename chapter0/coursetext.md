# Course Text

This text, *Mathematical Principals of GIS* is presented via the Open Source project [GitBook](http://gitbook.com).  The text is presented this way for tow reasons.  First, it allows us, the authors to, utilize GitHub to keep the text under version control (and constant revision).  Second, the text is available freely to anyone with access to the internet.

## Chapters
* Links to the text chapters are displayed in the left hand Table of Contents (ToC).  If the ToC is not visible, click the four icon with horizontal lines (upper left hand corner).
* Clicking on a link to a chapter (or sub-section) will navigate you to the selected page.
* Each chapter is composed of an overview, checklist, multiple content pages, and a summary page.
* Many content pages will also include external links and supplemental information.  This information is embedded in the text and may (will) not transfer well to printed or mobile form (Mobi or ePub).  I would suggest that you skim the material for the week and identify what items you want to access offline and what items require an internet connection.

## Discussion
The online Gitbook host offers a discussion feature.  By hovering over the right end of a paragraph (or any other block of text), you should see a small green plus sign appear.  By clicking on that plus sign, you can create a discussion post within the Gitbook interface.  For now, please feel free to use that feature for reporting typos or unclear sections of text.  For course questions or questions about the material, use the discussion forums.  

## Printing Options & Offline Verions
* In the ToC, clicking the top level [GIS220 link](https://www.gitbook.com/book/jlaura/gis220/details) will navigate you to a metadata page about this text.  On that page, you can download a PDF, ePub, or Mobi format version of this text.  The PDF should be well formatted for printing.
