# Augmented Matrix and Row Operations
In coming weeks we will look at solving systems of linear equations as it relates to spatial optimization problems.  Before doing that, I want to spend a bit more time looking at ways to characterize matrices.  One important characteristic is the rank.  Computing the rank requires the use of an augmented matrix and the application of elementary row operations (row reduction).
