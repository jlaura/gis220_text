# Overview
This is week two (of three) where we continue our review of linear algebra.  We will be focusing on methods to summarize information in a matrix as well as an initial introduction to elementary row operations.

## Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter and the assocaiated assignment, you will be able to:

* compute the determinant and trace of arbitrarily large matrices;
* identify uses of the trace and determinant in spatial econometrics;
* generate augmented matrices suitable for a number of applications, including solving systems of linear operations;
* apply elementary row operations;
* compute a matrix inversion.
