# Matrix Inverse

We can define a special matrix that is a **square** matrix, an inverse of a matrix.

The inverse of an $$n x n$$ matrix **A** is an $$nxn$$ matrix **B** such that

$$AB = BA = I$$, 

where **I** is the identity matrix.  If the above equality holds, then **B** is the inverse of **A** ($$\mathbf{A}^{-1}$$

If matrix **A** has an invsrse, if is said to be a *nonsingular matrix*.

## Computing the Inverse

It is possible to compute the inverse of a matrix using either elementary row operations (Gaussian Elimination really) or determinants.

Please see this [wonderful video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/precalc-matrices/intro-to-matrix-inverses/v/inverse-matrix-part-1) for a step by step computation.  The mechanics of computation starts about 6 minutes in.

As a practice problem, please see [this page](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-matrices/alg-determinants-and-inverses-of-large-matrices/e/matrix_inverse_3x3).  The linked videos (right hand column) illustrate the computation of the inverse using both elementary row operations and determinants.
