# Summary
In this chapter we continued working with matrices and focused on methods to summarize matrices, such as the determinant and trace.  We also introduced the augmented matrix (a key technique for solving systems of linear equations in later weeks) and elementary row operations.  We concluded the chapter by reformulating the algorithm to compute the intersection of two lines using determinants of homogeneous coordinates.
