# Overview
For the next two weeks the focus will be systems of linear equations and their application to spatial optimization problems.  Week one focuses on solving of systems (which is a review and additional practice from previous weeks) and techniques for formulating spatial optimization problems.

## Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter and the assocaiated assignment, you will be able to:

* formulate and solve systems of linear equations for two or more variables;
* formulate and solve spatial and non-spatial optimization problems;
* identify two common transportation spatial optimization problems;
* differentiate between linear and non-linear optimization problems.
