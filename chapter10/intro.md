# Introduction

This is week one of two focusing on systems of linear equations.  This week will focus on the mechanics of solving systems of linear equations and offer a brief introduction to optimization.  You might be wondering why systems of linear equations and optimization are being mixed.  The relationship should be more clear after next week, when we solve linear optimization problems.
