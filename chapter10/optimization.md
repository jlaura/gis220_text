# Optimization

Optimization problems are not unique to the spatial sciences.  In fact, the spatial sciences draw heavily from fields such as operations research and calculus for methods to formulate and solve optimization problems.  For a wonderful overview of the mathematics that drive the forumation of non-spatial optimization problems and a number of example problems, please see:

* [Paul's Online Calculus Notes: Optimization](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Optimization.aspx)

The process described in the above link is similar to the process of finding minima and maxima in one dimensional functions.  I suspect that the linked reading will generate a number of questions.  Please post these in the forums so that we can work through them together.
