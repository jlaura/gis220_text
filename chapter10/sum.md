# Summary
This week we reviewed using elementary row operations and the augmented matrix to formulate and solve systems of linear equations.  We also introduced concepts of mathematical optimization, draw from calculus, and then offered examples for optimization problem formulation.  The form Minimize/Maximize some function, Subject To some set of constraints will become a template for this type of problem.  We concluded this week offering two examples of spatial optimization problems in the transportation and operations research domain.
