# Summary

This week focused on different types of distributions and methods for sampling distributions.  We began by describing what a distrbution is.  Next the normal distribution was introduced and used as a tool to learn about the areas of a distribution and z-scores.  We then introduce other common distributions and distribution sampling.  As usual, we conclude by drawing linkages between the standard statistical (and mathematical) methods and usage within the GIScience (GISystems) domain.
