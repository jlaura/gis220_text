* [What is Central Tendency?](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/summarizing_distributions/what_is_ct.html)
* [Measures of Central Tendency](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/summarizing_distributions/measures.html) - I would simply skim this section.  We discussed most of these ideas under the context of summation notation.
