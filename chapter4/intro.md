Please read:

* [What is a distribution?](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/introduction/distributions.html)
* [Variability](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/summarizing_distributions/variability.html)
* [Measures of Central Tendency](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/summarizing_distributions/variability.html) - I would simply skim this section.  We discussed most of these ideas under the context of summation notation.
