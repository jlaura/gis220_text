# Uses of Probability in GIScience

## Spatial Randomness
A frequently asked question is whether an observed point pattern is randomly distributed.  For example, which of the following point patterns a **Completely Spatially Random** (CSR) and which are a product of either spatial dependence[^1] and/or spatial heterogeneity [^2]?

What techniques allow one to differentiate between a CSR process and one with some other, underlying cause?

### Spatial Laplace

[^1]: Spatial dependence, with respect to this point pattern example, describes the potential that the observation of a given occurence could be conditionally dependent upon another observation.  An intuitive (and timely) example, would be clusters of Zika virus.

[^2]: Spatial heterogeneity is an underlying spatial process that causes the intensity (or clustering) of a spatial point pattern to change.  Here in Northern Arizona, we see that occurences of ponderosa pine and gabel oak are effected by underlying spatial heterogeneity.  In the case of this example, the elevation and slope of specific micro-climates directly impacts where eash species grows.
