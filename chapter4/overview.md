# Overview
This chapter draws almost entirely from the [Online Stat Book](http://onlinestatbook.com) and focuses on distributions and sampling from distributions.  Many spatial analysis methods utilize estimated distributions and sampling.

## Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter and the assocaiated assignment, you will be able to:

* differentiate between normal, binomial, poisson, and multinomial distributions; 
* describe what a distribution estimates (and summarizes);
* define variability and describe measures of central tendency;
* identify uses of distributions and sampling within the spatial analysis and spatial statistics domains.
