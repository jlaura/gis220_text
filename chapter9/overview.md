# Overview
This is week three (of three) where we continue our review of linear algebra.  This week is a bit more geospatially focuses as the focus is spatial weights objects.  Spatial weights objects have frequent application in spatial econometrics and more generally spatial statistics.

## Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter and the assocaiated assignment, you will be able to:

* describe a spatial weights object;
* apply row standardization to a spatial weights object and explain why row standardization is used;
* spatially lag variables using a spatial weights object;
* identify spatial lag and spatial error regression models
* compute the Moran's I statistic using matrix and sigma notation.
