# Summary

This week we have taken a whirlwind review of algebra I and II.  Nothing should be earth shattering, but hopefully we are all on the same page.  You should be feeling comfortable with notation, function evaluation, and the necessary mechanics of algebraic simplification.  These are skills that we will be leveraging pretty heavily in the coming weeks.  

Take a look at the checklist and make sure that you have completed all of the necessary tasks.  Once you have, you are good to go for the week.

## A note on assignments

This semester I am trying something new.  The assignments are not designed to be mini-quizes.  Instead they are designed to be practice sets.  Some of the solutions will be easy - they might even come from the text.  Others will be challenging and are intentionally not directly covered in the text.  What should be covered are the basics that will support in you in figuring out how to acheive the solution or how to pose a question in the forum that will get you moving towards the solution.  This is why the assignments have an unlimited number of attempts.
