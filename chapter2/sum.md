# Summary

This week we have focused on some basic notation to provide a foundation for translating between the notation that you will encounter in texts and the vocabulary that we use daily to describe the same interactions.  We then introduced both Sigma $$\sum$$ and Pi $$\prod$$ notation that is essentially short-hand for generic summation or producs, respectively.  Finally, a few instances where these mathematical concepts are used in GISystems and GIScience were illustrated.
