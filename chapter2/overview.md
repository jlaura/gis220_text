# Overview
In this chapter we focus broadly on notation you are likley to encounter and then more specifically on the almost omni-present sigma ($$\Sigma$$) notation you will see throughout the GIScience literature.

## Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter and the assocaiated assignment, you will be able to:

* define commonly encountered mathematical notation and short-hand
* utilize mathematical notation to transmit ideas;
* evaluate functions using sigma notation;
* identify uses of sigma notation within the spatial analysis and spatial statistics domains.
