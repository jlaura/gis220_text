# Overview
This week, we conclude our brief focus on computational geometry, covering line and polygon algorithms and tree data models.

## Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter and the assocaiated assignment, you will be able to:

* define a line using multiple methods and identify four types of polygons;
* describe what a line-sweep is and it can be applied to finding the intersection of lines;
* compute the area of basic and composite simple polygons using decomposition methods and Green's Theorm;
* describe a binary tree and identify uses of a binary tree in a GISystem;
* articulate multiple uses for computational geometry within GIScience;
