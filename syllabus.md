**Course description:**

Contemporary research in analytical an quantitative geography has placed an increasing demand on the computational skills of its practitioners.  The advances in spatial data analysis and geographical modeling depend upon fundamental mathematical principals.  This mathematical knowledge is a fundamental component of a well rounded social or physical scientist.  Students undertaking research are often confronted with the prospect of applying geospatial methods without fully understanding the underlying mathematics or attempting to implement and apply methods available only within the geography literature.  This course is designed to provide the foundational knowledge to support the student in both of these cases.

**Course learning outcomes:**

For geography students, refresh the basic mathematical principals of notation, algebraic manipulation,

**Grading Policy:**

Grading in the course will be based on the following point system:

| **Component**                        | **Points**                           |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 12 Exercises                         | 600                                  |
| Exam 1                               | 200                                  |
| Exam 2                               | 200                                  |
| Total                                | 1000                                 |

**Exams** will be based on the readings, discussion forum posts, and exercises. All exams are cumulative.  Late exams will not be accepted.

**Exercises** will be posted on Blackboard every Tuesday and are due the following Tuesday.  Exercises are available for unlimited attempts during that time.  Late assignments will not be accepted.  A total of 13 exercises are assigned.  The lowest exercise grade will be dropped.

There are **no extra credit assignments** to make up for poor performance on exams, exercises, or missed in-class activities.

**Academic integrity**

The ASU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.
These violations fall into five broad areas that include but are not
limited to: cheating on an academic evaluation or assignment,
plagiarizing, academic deceit, such as fabricating data or information,
aiding academic integrity policy violations and inappropriately
collaborating, or falsifying academic records. For more information
