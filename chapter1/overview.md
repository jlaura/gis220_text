# Overview
In this chapter we review functions, variables, and the notation to be used throughout this course.  

## Objectives
This chapter is designed as a refresher chapter to ensure that we are all working from the same foundation.  At the conclusion of this chapter and the assocaiated assignment, you will be able to:

* describe components of a function, including input, relationship, and output;
* identify and differentiate between constants, variables, and coefficients;
* define commonly encountered mathematical notation and short-hand;
* describe a Cartesian coordinate system in mathematical terms;
* demonstrate graphing of a function;
* complete an algebra review assignment including factorization of polynomials.
