# Monomials and Polynomials

Monomials, binomials, trinomials and polynomials all describe the number of variables in a function or equation.

## Monomials

Monomials are the product of non-negative powers of variables composed of one (mono) term.  In other words, a monomial is a single number, variable, or product of numbers and variables with a whole number exponent.  For example:

* $$15$$
* $$-15$$
* $$x^{12}$$
* $$2ab$$
* $$11a^{2}b^{3}$$

## Binomails and Trinomials
Binomials are simply the sum of two monomials.  For example:

* $$x + 15$$
* $$a - 15$$
* $$x^{12} + 2y$$

To get to trinomials, we simply extend to a third term.  For example:

* $$2a - 3b + x^{2}$$
* $$11a^{2}b^{3} - 2a^{2} + 4b^{4}$$

## Polynomials
Finally, polynomials (poly simply meaning many) are the sum of four or more terms.  In practice, trinomials (and binomials) are called polynomials.  Using the above example:

* $$x^{2} + xy + y^{3}$$


# Adding (Subtracting) Polynomials
Adding and subtracting polynomials is as simple as combining like terms using the standard [order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) or ([video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics/core-algebra-foundations/algebra-foundations-order-of-operations/v/introduction-to-order-of-operations)).

It is probably most effective to look at doing this with an example:  Add $$4x^{2} + 3y to 6x^{2} + 2y + z$$.  Here we simply identify like terms.  In this case, $$x^{2}$$ and $$y$$ (ignoring the coefficients) appear in both elements.  Once identified, we simply combine these:

* $$(4x^{2} + 3y) + (6x^{2} + 2y + z)$$
* $$= 4x^{2} + 3y + 6x^{2} + 2y + z$$
* $$= 10x^{2} + 5y + z$$

# Multiplying (Dividing) Polynomials

Note: These examples are from [Paul's online math notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/Polynomials.aspx)

As above, except now we have a few exponent rules to remember (see the summary for a link to a cheet sheat with exponent rules).  Using another example, multiple the following: $$4x^{2}(x^{2} - 6x + 2$$).  

$$= 4x^{4} - 24x^{3} + 8x^{2}$$ so simple application of the distributive law.

We can add to the complexity a bit with: 

* $$(3x + 5)(x - 10)$$
* $$= 3x^{2} - 30x + 5x - 50$$
* $$= 3x^{2} - 25x - 50$$
