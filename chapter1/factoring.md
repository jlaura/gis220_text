# Factoring Polynomials

When we factor polynomials the is to *completely factor* meaning we can not acheive any more factoring.  The resultant equation or function will be composed of positive primes (prime numbers).  If we wanted to factor 12 to a series of positive primes we could:

* $$12 = 3 x 4$$
* $$= 3 x 2 x 2$$

At the second bullet, the scalar (12) has been completely factored.  We do the same thing with polynomials.  Assume we had a polynomial: $$a^{2} + 25$$.  We could factor this to be $$(a + 5)(a + 5)$$.

## Greatest Common Factor
The first technique to try is to factor out the greatest common factor.  For example, we see the relationship:

$$a(b + c) = ab + ac$$

On the right hand side of the equality, the greatest common factor is $$a$$.  We reverse the distributive law, and voila, can factor to the left hand side.  (Check out the additional links in the summary for a cheat sheet with a reminder of these rules.  Here is an example:

Assume we are given: $$2x^{2} - 18x - 72$$.  First, we can factor out the 2:

$$ 2(x^{2} - 9x - 36)$$

Then we can factor the expression in the paranthesis, yielding completely factored expression:

$$2(x + 3)(x - 12)$$
