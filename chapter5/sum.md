# Summary

This week we introduced the topic of computational geometry within the broader framework of computational thinkings.  We described what an algorithm is and how they can be used to efficiently communicate the steps necessary to perform some task.  We then discussed different metrics for the computation of distance, a key metric for many computational geometry problems.  Two algorithms, Douglas-Peucker line simplification and the gift-wrapping, convext hull algorithm were then introduced.  Continuing with the point pattern analysis theme, we conclude with a short section on simulation.
