# Overview
This week we shift focus from probability and distirbutions to the a review of some of the fundamental computational geometry techniques that support vector based map operations and spatial analysis.

## Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter and the assocaiated assignment, you will be able to:

* define efficiency in the context of computational geometry;
* describe what an algorithm is and how ideas can be communicated to a computer;
* identify multiple different methods to compute distance and the situations where one method might be preferable;
* apply two computational geometry algorithms, line simplification and convex hull identification, to real world problems;
* describe Monte Carlo simulation and what broad problems can be solved through simulation;
